The first "serious" piece I learned for piano was Chopin's Prelude in E minor. It is a languid, lyrical piece, short and quiet with a distinctly funerary air. My edition was entirely unsuited to the emotional quality of the pieces, with a neon cover and a garish, fading blackletter announcing the composers name and the comparative difficulties of the pieces inside.

I took to it quickly. I remember sitting there, timid, at the piano bench, fearing that the downstairs neighbors might make the dreaded call *diplomatically* articulating their concerns about soundproofing, or that I wouldn't be able to read the music at all. And yet, in two weeks, I could manage to push through it, gingerly tapping the keys for fear of disrupting the balance my teacher had emphasized, and utterly engrossed in the contour of the melody, the virtuosic (at that time, at least) climax, and that then-terrifying cadence.

I was fourteen then. I am not a musical prodigy, and talk of "talent", of "natural gifts", then and now, makes me uneasy. Those early steps - posture, playing scales, the rudiments of reading music - had to be coaxed out of me over the course of many miserable lessons and exhausted teachers. The courtesy of those young men and women - to deal with a 9-year-old just now encountering the shocking fact that there were things he was not good at - astounds me to this day. Needless to say, my early musical education was brief and difficult.

Despite this, I still returned to the piano as often as I could. I would sit and press the keys, convinced that I could stumble into the music that lay just out of reach. I would sit, as the emotions bubbled up, and improvise endlessly, holding down the sustain pedal for far too long as I played chord after chord. The colors and textures I couldn't quite reach — the lush extensions of jazz ballads, the virtuosity of a romantic etude, the intricacies of a four-voice fugue — tormented me, heard and felt but never *embodied*.

In 8th grade, brimming with trepidation, I decided to try again. I learned the basics of theory and played pop songs off of ad-ridden guitar chord websites. I wrote a bit too: a Klezmer piece, the odd duet for two violins, a pop song. I wrote for myself, playing with the sounds I was beginning to discover. I didn't know how, really. I broke every rule in the book, my output was formless and dissonant. The occasional interesting idea broke through, but it was soon reclaimed by the waves of what I retroactively learned were Tristan chords. 

Yet, there was *something* there.

My parents, ever supportive, insisted on showing my score to as many people as possible, and I got a surprisingly positive response. It satisfied something deep in my psyche, the stream of positivity for something *I* created. I felt empowered, enthusiastic, and the seed of an ambition formed in my mind. I would become a composer. I would study at a conservatory, I would play intensely, I would learn intensely and share my "gift" with the world.

This period of my life didn't last long. When I was twelve or thirteen, my grandfather passed away. It was a cruel death, the sort that leaves a bad taste in the mouth and a hole in the heart. He was in decline for years before it, the sparkle in his eyes, his quick wits, slowly replaced by an incoherent discontentment. It terrified me — the fear of fading, of forgetting — overtook my mind in its way.
