> Following through on goals is important. Why? Because eventually, you'll end up in a situation where you *won't* be able to back out, and you need practice. 

I have too many goals. Contradictory goals, incoherent, goals that aren't practically, or, in many cases, physically attainable.

I'm sure you've encountered the *goal-oriented mindset* before, pervasive both in the legitimate, academic [theory of agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_orientation) and the dark back alleys of [LinkedIn influencers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-built-goal-oriented-mindset-level-up-my-life-tanmay-goel) (see [$E = mc^2 + \text{AI}$](/img/goals/plusai.jpg)).  I've heard about growth mindsets and self-actualization, about [atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), about [nudges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)), and while I'm certain those theories are helpful - they've certainly been helpful to me - they only address one part of the problem.

None of them, for me, have solved that core question: *what do you do when you want to do everything?* For all of the late night career quizzes, for all of the conversations I've had, for all of the research, I still can't tell you if I'd rather be a concert pianist or a number theorist, an engineer or a journalist, a fiery freelancer or a career academic. It's not that I haven't found my "calling", exactly. I *have* found my calling, of course: simultaneously, with all of my unlimited time and resources, being a musician and a mathematician and an author and a lawyer and a psychologist and a dozen other things.

I try to prioritize, I really do. It become less plausible by the day, though.
