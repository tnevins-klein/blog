This site uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with a custom theme (nicknamed *Stanza*), and is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). There is no CMS! I write my posts in `vim` (or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md))and push them to GitHub.

The mathematical formulas are rendered with \\(\LaTeX\\) and [KaTeX](https://katex.org/). I'm hoping to incorperate [Typst](https://typst.app/) soon. My LaTeX and diagramming workflow are heavily inspired by Giles Castel's excellent [series](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) on VimTeX.

$$\int_0^1 f(x) dx = 4$$

Aesthetically, I decided to go for a very minimal, easy to maintain design, and avoid the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) temptation, however alluring it may be. The only JavaScript is for rendering mathematical formulas.

### Personal Hardware
I use a combination of an Intel NUC running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) and a MacBook Pro. It works, and I don't have much more to say than that.
